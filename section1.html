        <h2>The Basic Rules:</h2> 
* Volleyball revolves around a ball and the act of making sure it does not drop on your side. A net divides the two
team's ball boundaries but players can run outside of the boundaries in order to keep the ball in play. Each team
gets <b>3 contacts</b> with the ball to try and bring the ball over to the other team's side. If team 1 touches
the ball, then team 2 will get their 3 touches back again and vice versa. Any contact of the ball with any part of the body counts as a touch.
Each touch of the ball can only be for a fraction of a second or it will be a foul. 
        <br>
        <br>
* A point is awarded based on <b>scoring or fouls</b>. A direct score can be made by making the ball drop inbounds on the 
opponent's side of the court. Fouls will <b>immediately</b> reward the other teams with a point, common fouls include 
net touches, double touches by the same player, prolonged contact with the ball, out of boundary ball drop, and 4 touches.
        <br>
        <br>
* Each point begins with one of the team's serving the ball. From behind the serve line, they hit the ball into the court and over the net to the opposing team. If the serving team scores, they continue to serve. If the receiving team scores, they now serve for the next point, and rotate all players one position clockwise.
        <br>
        <br>
* There are 6 positions on the court and each player is assigned to one before each serve. This changes as they rotate throughout the set. Basic rules state that the 3 backrow players are <b>not allowed</b> to attack or block past the attack line. They must also follow the rules of rotation before the serve is made, after the ball is in play all players may move freely about the court.
        <br>
        <br>
* The win condition: For <b>competitive</b> play, the teams may play best of 3 or 5 sets depending on the rules. To win a set, a team must reach <b>25 points</b> and be at least 2 points ahead of the opposing team. If a team reaches 25 and aren't 
at least 2 points ahead of the opposing team, the game will continue until either team fulfills both conditions.
