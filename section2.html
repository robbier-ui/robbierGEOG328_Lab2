        <h2>Positions:</h2> 
The rotation system in volleyball create restrictions with nuance that allows for roles and strategies to be created. 
<h3>Setter</h3>
This player is the designated playmaker of the team, usually taking the second touch to <b>set the ball to the team's attackers</b>, providing them with precision and oppourtunies to score.
<h3>Outside Hitter 1 and 2</h3> 
These two players are the <b>primary receivers and attackers</b> for the team.
<h3>Opposite Hitter</h3>
This player plays opposite from the setter in rotation and is usually <b>always ready to attack</b>.
<h3>Middle Blockers 1 and 2</h3>
These two players are the primary <b>blockers</b> for the team, they focus in attacking from the center and shutting down the opposing team's attacks from the net.
<h3>Libero</h3> 
This player switches in with the middle blockers to take charge in <b>receiving</b> and <b>defense</b> in the backrow. When the rules of rotation put them in the front row, they are usually switched out for the middle blocker.
